## Class Notes

This is a site built to act as a guide and reference to learn coding.

I am teaching a class at a local homeschooling cooperative on coding and I am building this site with them in mind. However, anyone who is interested may use this as a resource.

Sites like w3 schools or MDN are far more comprehensive, but they can be a bit daunting due to their scope. I feel my value add is that the info presented here is presented in a more natural tone and the information is a bit more digestible.

Feel free to contribute changes as you feel necessary.

This site is build with [Astro.build](https://astro.build) and uses [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) to organize and present the content.

To run the site locally using pnpm clone the repository, navigate to the directory and run
