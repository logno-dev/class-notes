Part of a developers job is to handle that output, make it useful to someone. That could be as simple as displaying that output on a screen. Displaying output on a screen could be in the form of an application, which would need to be built specifically for each platform. These are called native apps and they require knowledge of system calls and tooling that is specific to each platform.
