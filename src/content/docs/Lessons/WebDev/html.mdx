<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language used to tell the browser what elements to display. It is composed of opening and closing tags enclosed in angle brackets. The different tags define the behavior of the content within the tags. Each tag may optionally contain attributes that further define the behavior of the tag and thus the content within.

The following is a basic html file:

<Code code={htmlExample} lang="html" title="index.hml" />
